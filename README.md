# Word Search Solver
This is a basic java program that solves an input word search.
You have the option to either use the Solver.java file to input everything by Scanner, or you can elect to use the SolverWithIO.java if you'd prefer to input information into the included .txt files in the project folder. While you will still have to identify where these files are and enter them into the program, It is a little easier than having to input all of the words and the entire word searchg line by line.
If you elect to use SolverWithIO.java, the Words.txt file must start with a number corresponding to the total number of words you've entered. WordSearch.txt must also begin with the columns in the word search and the rows of the word search.
